-	Prediction of store sales
  -	Machine learning approach
  -	Deep Learning approach
-	Serving predictions on a web interface

### Task 1 - Exploration of Customer Purchasing Behavior
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) has been completed, encompassing:

Data cleaning to handle outliers and missing values using pipelines.
Visualizations of features and interactions to communicate findings effectively.
Key questions answered include:
Distribution comparison of promotions between training and test sets.
Sales behavior analysis around holidays.
Identification of seasonal purchase behaviors.
Correlation between sales and customer count.
Impact analysis of promotions on sales and customer behavior.
Store-specific insights regarding promotions, opening times, assortment types, and competitor distances.

### Task 2 - Prediction of Store Sales
The following steps have been completed:

Preprocessing including conversion of non-numeric columns, handling NaN values, and feature extraction from datetime columns.
Building and training a predictive model for store sales.
Scaling the data using sklearn's standard scaler for better predictions.
